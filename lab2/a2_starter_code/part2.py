    policy_iteration method implements POLICY ITERATION MDP solver,
    shown in AIMA (3ed pg 657). The goal is to produce an optimal policy
    for any given mdp environment.

    Inputs-
        agent: The MDP solving agent (mdp_agent)
        env:   The MDP environment (mdp_env)
        max_iter: Max iterations for the algorithm

    Outputs -
        policy: A list/array of actions for each state
                (Terminal states can have any random action)
       <agent>  Implicitly, you are populating the utlity matrix of
                the mdp agent. Do not return this function.
